# Capstone Project: Heart Attack Risk Prediction in Female Populations
##üöß In Progress

Developing a **Logistic Regression machine learning model to predict heart attack risk in female populations**. The focus is on identifying key predictive factors such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, smoking, obesity, and stress and understanding their interrelationships.
Using a dataset from Kaggle, containing 8,763 patient entries, with 2,652 female patients, the goal is to accurately predict heart attack risk based on health metrics, lifestyle factors, and medical history.
The model is evaluated using Python, applying metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance. By tailoring this model to women‚Äôs unique cardiovascular risk factors, this project seeks to improve early detection, personalized treatment, and clinical practices related to heart disease in women.

## üîç Key Findings on Feature Importance

-  **Top Predictive Features in the Dataset**:
  - **Stress Level** (**7.33%**) is the most important predictor.
  - **Sleep Hours Per Day** (**6.18%**) and **Sedentary Hours Per Day** (**6.17%**) follow closely.
  
-  **Smoking is Not a Key Predictor**:
  - Smoking was **not selected** as a top-ranked feature by the model.
  - The lowest-ranked features, **Obesity (5.56%)** and **Diabetes (5.51%)**, still had **higher importance scores** than Smoking.
  - While **Smoking correlates with Age**, it was **not a direct driver** of heart attack risk.
  - **Other health factors (e.g., Stress, Cholesterol, Sleep, Sedentary Behavior)** contributed more predictive value.

-  **Why Smoking Was Not a Key Feature**:
  - The dataset was transformed using **PCA**, which combined **Smoking** with other features into **principal components**.
  - **SHAP Correlation** measures **linear relationships**, while **Random Forest & tree-based models** capture **complex, nonlinear interactions**.
