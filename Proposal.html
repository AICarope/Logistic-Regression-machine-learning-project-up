"Machine Learning and Logistic Regression in Heart Attack Risk Prediction for Female Populations"


1. Domain Background
Cardiovascular diseases, particularly heart attacks, remain a leading cause of mortality globally, with distinct risk factors between men and women. This study, "Machine Learning and Logistic Regression in Heart Attack Risk Prediction for Female Populations," 
seeks to address this gender gap by developing predictive models that specifically focus on women. 
Using logistic regression and machine learning techniques, the goal is to analyze the key health risks contributing to heart attacks in women, including factors like age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, smoking, stress, and more.

Heart attack symptoms can be subtle in women and often differ from men’s classic symptoms (such as chest pain):
	• Fatigue: Unusual fatigue, especially if it's new or dramatic, may be a warning sign.
	• Shortness of Breath: Even without chest pain, it can indicate cardiovascular stress.
	• Back, Neck, or Jaw Pain: These are more common heart attack symptoms in women.
	• Nausea or Vomiting: Women may experience this symptom without any chest pain.
	• Lightheadedness or Dizziness: This is also a possible warning signs
    • Pressure or Tightness in the Chest: Though chest pain is common in men, women often describe it as pressure or discomfort rather than sharp pain.

This project leverages a diverse dataset comprising attributes such as Patient ID, Age, Sex, Cholesterol, Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, Diabetes, Family History, Smoking, Obesity, Alcohol Consumption, Exercise Hours Per Week, Diet, Previous Heart Problems, 
Medication Use, Stress Level, Sedentary Hours Per Day, Income, BMI, Triglycerides, Physical Activity Days Per Week, Sleep Hours Per Day, Country, Continent, and Hemisphere. These features allow for a comprehensive risk assessment and the identification of key 
contributors to heart attacks in female populations. Through this study, the goal is to create more personalized and accurate heart attack risk models tailored to women's health profiles.
