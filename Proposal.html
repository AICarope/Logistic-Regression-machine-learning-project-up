"Machine Learning and Logistic Regression in Heart Attack Risk Prediction for Female Populations"


1. Domain Background
Cardiovascular diseases, particularly heart attacks, remain a leading cause of mortality globally, with distinct risk factors between men and women. This study, "Machine Learning and Logistic Regression in Heart Attack Risk Prediction for Female Populations," 
seeks to address this gender gap by developing predictive models that specifically focus on women. 
Using logistic regression and machine learning techniques, the goal is to analyze the key health risks contributing to heart attacks in women, including factors like age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, smoking, stress, and more.

Heart attack symptoms can be subtle in women and often differ from men’s classic symptoms (such as chest pain):
	• Fatigue: Unusual fatigue, especially if it's new or dramatic, may be a warning sign.
	• Shortness of Breath: Even without chest pain, it can indicate cardiovascular stress.
	• Back, Neck, or Jaw Pain: These are more common heart attack symptoms in women.
	• Nausea or Vomiting: Women may experience this symptom without any chest pain.
	• Lightheadedness or Dizziness: This is also a possible warning signs
    • Pressure or Tightness in the Chest: Though chest pain is common in men, women often describe it as pressure or discomfort rather than sharp pain.

This project leverages a diverse dataset comprising attributes such as Patient ID, Age, Sex, Cholesterol, Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, Diabetes, Family History, Smoking, Obesity, Alcohol Consumption, Exercise Hours Per Week, Diet, Previous Heart Problems, 
Medication Use, Stress Level, Sedentary Hours Per Day, Income, BMI, Triglycerides, Physical Activity Days Per Week, Sleep Hours Per Day, Country, Continent, and Hemisphere. These features allow for a comprehensive risk assessment and the identification of key 
contributors to heart attacks in female populations. Through this study, the goal is to create more personalized and accurate heart attack risk models tailored to women's health profiles.


2. Problem Statement
Develop a Logisitcs Regression based machine learning model to analyze the associations between females with predictions of heart attack, while seeking to understand the interrelationships and potential predictive factors for Age, Sex, Cholesterol, 
Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, Diabetes, Family History, Smoking, Obesity, Alcohol Consumption, Exercise Hours Per Week, Diet, Previous Heart Problems, 
Medication Use, Stress Level, Sedentary Hours Per Day, Income, BMI, Triglycerides, Physical Activity Days Per Week, Sleep Hours Per Day, Country, Continent, and Hemisphere. These features allow for a comprehensive risk assessment and the identification of key 
contributors to heart attacks in female populations. Through this study, is to create more personalized and accurate heart attack risk models tailored to women's health profiles.
The predictive model can have an accuracy of 80% as a baseline and it will be evaluated after executing a detail analysis using Python for Data Science and Machine learning algorithms.

Step 8: Recommendation:
Certain cardiovascular risks are influenced by sex and gender. For example, lower estrogen levels in younger women and pregnancy complications can raise cardiovascular risks. Gender-related factors include marital stress and lower socioeconomic status, 
both linked to heart disease and heart attacks in women. Recognizing these differences is important for understanding cardiovascular disease (CVD) in women and developing targeted interventions like screenings to improve outcomes. In this context,
"women" refers to the female sex unless otherwise stated.
